"""steward agent — deterministic anomaly signals the `/steward` skill drives via Bash.

Flow the agent follows each run:
  1. `python3 -m triggered_agents steward scan`  -> JSON batch of anomaly signals since the
     watermark (see signals.py for the five kinds). Nothing here judges or writes anything —
     that is entirely the skill's job, same split as curator/retro.
  2. agent investigates by its own judgment (transcripts, workspaces, repos, curator/retro
     output — everything is readable), fixes what blocks the pipeline right now (infra/
     control-panel, direct commit), files cards for the rest, escalates what it cannot resolve
     to Blocked with a writeup, comments on every card it touched, and posts the run's report as
     a comment on the wake-up report card the dispatcher created for this run (triggered-
     agents-255/259 — no more markdown file in control-panel/docs/steward/).
  3. `python3 -m triggered_agents steward advance`  -> folds the scanned state into the
     watermark, so a condition that hasn't changed does not re-spawn the head next hour.

Two-phase like curator/retro: a crash before advance re-scans instead of dropping a signal.
`scan --json` emits the structured batch; `precheck` exits non-zero when there is no signal (so
the systemd gate can skip the run, zero LLM cost); `status` shows the watermark.

Second, unconditional mode (triggered-agents-254): `deep-sweep-since`/`deep-sweep-advance` keep
a separate watermark — just a timestamp, not a per-kind dedup like signals.py's — for the daily
whole-system audit that runs with no precheck gate at all (deploy/provision.py's second
ta-steward-deep-sweep timer). Kept independent on purpose: the signal gate must not swallow an
anomaly the daily sweep hasn't looked at yet, and vice versa.
