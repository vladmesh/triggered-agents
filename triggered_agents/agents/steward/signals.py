"""Deterministic anomaly signals — what the steward's precheck gate and `/steward` skill both
read before anything judges.

Five signal kinds (2026-07-04 design grill, memory id 83 — "стюард присмотр пайплайн дизайн"):
new Blocked card, warn/error/head-health-flip line in the pipeline's own runs.jsonl since the
steward's watermark, a card sitting in an active column past STALE_HOURS, a resource health
flip, a worker/reviewer workspace on disk with no in-flight card record. Any one is enough for
precheck to spawn the head; finding none costs nothing (a few Kanboard reads and a couple of
local file stats, no LLM).

Every signal dedupes against a persisted "already notified" watermark (state/steward/
watermark.json), the same shape as curator/retro's watermark but keyed by anomaly kind rather
than by source: a condition that hasn't changed since the last run (a card still sitting in
Blocked, a resource still red) does not re-spawn the head every hour — the steward already
looked, and re-litigating an unresolved anomaly on an unchanged state is exactly the kind of
hourly LLM-cost sweep this agent is not meant to be. `scan` is read-only; `advance` (cli.py, only
after the skill has actually looked at the batch) folds the scanned state into the watermark —
two-phase like curator/retro, so a crash between scan and advance re-scans instead of silently
dropping a signal.

# can never exist there: `_log_signals` on a missing file returned no hits, indistinguishable
# from "checked, nothing new" — the steward was permanently blind to the dispatcher's log
# (triggered-agents-253). The dispatcher's real state lives in ITS OWN named worktree, a sibling
# of the steward's under the same workspaces root — cross that boundary explicitly the same way
# `_orphan_signals` already does for other agents' worktrees via WORKSPACES_ROOT, never through
