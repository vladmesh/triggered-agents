"""Deep-sweep drift check (triggered-agents-256): live ta-* systemd units plus the installed
precheck gate script vs. what deploy/provision.py would install right now from the current
triggered_agents/agents/*/automation.toml specs and repo copy of deploy/ta-gate.sh. Also flags a
double-schedule (triggered-agents-444): for an agent whose spec OPTS IN to single-scheduler
ownership (`[trigger] enabled = false`, e.g. curator), ta-<agent>.timer live on the host while the
same-named Orca automation still has its own trigger enabled — live state contradicting that
agent's own canon, which would let one hourly tick dispatch twice. An agent that never made that
promise (retro, steward) is not checked at all — its Orca automation being enabled is its
unchanged, intended state, not drift. Detection only, called from the deep-sweep section of
`.claude/skills/steward/SKILL.md`; filing an Идеи card with the diff is the skill's job, not this
module's. Auto-healing the drift is explicitly out of scope for this card (a live systemd rewrite
belongs to a human-reviewed provision run, not an unconditional daily sweep).

Reuses deploy/provision.py's own unit-string builders (_service_unit/_timer_unit/
_variant_service_unit) instead of reimplementing the rendering: two independently maintained
renderers of the same unit text would drift from EACH OTHER as much as from the host, defeating
the whole point of this check. Reads specs from THIS process's own checkout (the steward's named
worktree, kept current by the pipeline dispatcher's every-tick fast-forward,
worker._ff_agent_worktrees) rather than the canonical ~/triggered-agents checkout, which nothing
keeps up to date between provision runs and would otherwise make every comparison stale by
definition.
