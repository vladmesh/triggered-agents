"""Validate column — layers 1-3, driven from dispatcher.tick per card, zero LLM except the
independent layer-3 reviewer head.

layer 1 (mechanical, PR project): poll the card's PR through gh (worker.poll_pr) — CI red bounces
    the card back to In progress with a scrubbed comment and a nudge to the live worker; CI green
    moves on. A rollup stuck on PENDING/NONE (gh answers, but no check ever finishes) is watched by
    its own time-based watchdog (_ci_pending_watchdog, CI_PENDING_STALL_SECONDS) — a required check
    that never posts, a job waiting on manual environment approval, or a removed workflow otherwise
    leaves the card unwatched in Validate forever, the one class neither the worker watchdog
    (In-progress only) nor the layer-3 review watchdog (fires only after CI-green) covers. A
    contrib (fork) card has no PR in this pipeline by definition (a human opens it
    against upstream from the pushed branch afterward) — layer 1 there is just the worker's own
    report:done, which must carry `branch:`/`head:` protocol lines instead of a PR link (the
    proof-of-push, parsed back by _contrib_ref); no gh call at all, but the claimed sha is checked
    against the branch's real head on origin (worker.remote_head_sha) right before the reviewer
    would be spawned — a mismatch stalls instead of reviewing a state the worker never claimed
    (_validate_contrib_card), since the worker's session lives on and could keep pushing.
layer 2 (stand, PR projects only): for a project with a `[stand]` manifest section, deploy the PR
    branch and run e2e (_stand_gate) before layer 3 — green only after a green stand run, one
    auto-retry then Blocked. Never applies to a contrib card.
layer 3 (independent review, every project): once the lower layers are green, spawn a reviewer
    head (not the worker, no code access — worker.spawn_reviewer) off the card's own branch (PR or
    contrib, the same branch-based bring-up either way, except a contrib card pins the reviewer's
    worktree to the exact verified sha rather than the branch's live tip) and drive it by its
    verdict exactly the way dispatcher._advance drives an In-progress card by the worker's report:
    spawn once per code state, read the verdict past a baseline, act. Red -> back to In progress
    with a nudge, up to REVIEW_RETURN_CAP returns over the card's life, then Blocked до vladmesh.
    Green on a PR project (stand or not) triggers the dispatcher's own squash merge, one-shot, but
    only once the PR's actual base (gh) matches resolve_base_branch(project, card.base_branch) —
    a mismatch (e.g. a sprint-shim card's PR opened against main instead of sprint/NNN) Blocks
    instead of merging into the wrong branch. A failed merge attempt (conflict, red required
    check, gh down) also goes straight to Blocked, never a retry-loop — TA_AUTOMERGE=off reverts
    this to waiting for a human merge, no redeploy needed.
    Green on a contrib card has nothing to wait for (no PR in this pipeline) and goes straight to
    Done with the worker workspace torn down. A reviewer that goes silent without a verdict is
    caught by the same watchdog threshold as a worker head, frozen the same way while its resource
    sits red (_review_watchdog).

`run(records, watchdog_seconds, save_cards, statuses)` is the single entry point dispatcher.tick
calls once per tick; every other name here is private. `watchdog_seconds`, `save_cards` and
`statuses` are threaded in rather than imported from dispatcher — dispatcher owns WATCHDOG_SECONDS
(also driving the In-progress worker watchdog), cards.json persistence and health.refresh's
per-tick result, and importing them back here would be a circular import.

    also out of scope) and layer 2 (stand) never applies. The report must carry the branch + head
    sha the worker pushed to their fork's origin (the protocol line dispatcher._task_md writes,

    Missing it stalls exactly like a missing PR link (_validate_stall, same cap and eventual
    Blocked), but under its own reason: a contrib card must never take the no-pr-ref path, since it
    has no PR by definition.

    The claimed sha is not trusted on its own: a worker may keep pushing after report:done (the
    session lives on until Done/Blocked), so the branch head a review would land on can drift past
    what the report claims. worker.remote_head_sha reads the real head straight off origin right

    missing branch/sha does, giving the worker a chance to push a matching sha and re-report rather
    than reviewing a state it never claimed.

    The comparison is a case-insensitive prefix match, not equality: `_CONTRIB_HEAD_RE` (and real
    workers via `git rev-parse --short`/`git push`'s own output) allows an abbreviated and/or
    mixed-case sha, while `git ls-remote` (remote_head_sha) always answers with the full 40-char
    lowercase object name. A plain `!=` would flag an honestly-matching short/mixed-case sha as a
    mismatch and escalate a perfectly good report to Blocked — the exact false-positive this gate
