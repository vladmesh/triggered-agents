"""Worker/reviewer head transitions for hard pause and resume — the one place that decides,
for a card whose live terminal was stopped by a freeze, whether it should move by an already
posted report, relaunch a fresh head, or stay parked for a lazy rework return.

Split out of dispatcher.py (triggered-agents-399) for two reasons the third-review verdict on
PR #85 made concrete:

  * one source of truth. The "move an In-progress card by its worker's [report:done]/
    [report:blocked]" step used to be inlined in dispatcher._advance and NOT applied on the resume
    path, so resume() would relaunch a fresh head into a card that had already reported during the
    freeze — a new terminal under a card in Validate/Blocked that nobody owned (review blocker B1).
    apply_report_transition() now holds that step and both _advance and resume_hard call it before
    ever touching a head, so a report that landed mid-freeze always wins over a relaunch.

  * dispatcher.py was pushed over the 1000-line review ceiling by the pause/resume/park logic.
    Moving the stop loop, the resume loop and the relaunch helper here keeps that state machine in
    one cohesive module instead of sprawled across _advance, pause() and resume().

Dependency injection mirrors validate.run: the caller (dispatcher) still owns cards.json I/O and
passes in refresh_worker_task, so this module imports only the low-level layers (ops/worker/
validate/model/naming) and never imports dispatcher back.
