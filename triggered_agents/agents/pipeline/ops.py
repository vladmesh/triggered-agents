"""Pipeline Kanboard operations — the deterministic board side of the task pipeline.

One Kanboard project (model.BOARD_NAME) is the board, model.COLUMNS its columns, one
swimlane per source project. Cards are keyed by a board-wide unique `reference`
(`<project>-<task_id>` when the PO does not supply one). Card state that the dispatcher
reasons over (type, project, predecessor, model, claim owner) lives in task metadata, a
flat str->str dict, so a reader needs only getTaskByReference + getTaskMetadata.

Guards live here, not in prompts. `move_card` defers to model.check_move; `claim_card` is
the only way into "In progress" and runs the entry guards (Ready, unclaimed, predecessor
Done, one code task per project, global cap) under a host-local lock — Kanboard has no
compare-and-swap, so a single dispatcher plus the lock is what serializes claims.

Metadata is fetched per task (N+1) in the list/guards; the board is small, so this stays
cheap and keeps each helper self-contained.
