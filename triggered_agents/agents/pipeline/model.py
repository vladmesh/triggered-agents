"""Pipeline domain model — pure, no I/O.

The pipeline board is the operational task queue: the PO (secretary) writes specs into
cards, a deterministic dispatcher claims Ready cards and spawns workers, workers report
via comments. Column transitions are guarded here, in code, keyed by role — not by trusting
a prompt. A worker can never move a card; the dispatcher can never skip a guard.

The one path into "In progress" is the `claim` command, not a `move`. Claim is separate
because entering work is not a plain transition: it also picks a worker, checks the
predecessor is Done, enforces one code task per project, and honours a global cap. Folding
all that into the move matrix would hide it. So Ready->"In progress" is deliberately absent
from TRANSITIONS, and `move` to In progress errors with a pointer at `claim`.

steward has every po transition plus one override, Blocked->Done (STEWARD_OVERRIDE): a legal
replacement for a human editing the board's raw Kanboard API to force a card past review, which is
what happened on agent-kanban-232/235 and triggered-agents-230. The override still needs a paper
trail, so ops.move_card requires a non-empty justification comment in the same call before it will
run it; every other role stays exactly as guarded as before.

steward can also move any active card straight to Blocked (2026-07-04 design grill, memory:
"стюард присмотр пайплайн дизайн") — the one escalation path its whole mandate rests on ("не
решается своими силами -> Blocked с разбором и жди человека", no numeric caps). This is a manual
break-glass action a human would otherwise have to do by hand through the Kanboard UI when the
dispatcher itself is the thing that broke (a claimed In-progress/Validate card's watchdog never
fires if the tick that would run it is dead) — the dispatcher's own In progress/Validate -> Blocked
stays automatic and unaffected; this is steward reaching in from outside that loop.
