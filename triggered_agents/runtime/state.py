"""Watermark + lock, shared by every triggered-agent. Each agent gets its own state dir.

Watermark: an agent remembers how far it has already processed each source (curator:
lines past a JSONL count). The watermark advances ONLY after the agent's durable output
is committed (two-phase), so a crash mid-run re-processes rather than silently dropping.

Lock: one lockfile guards a run. Orca already serializes runs of one automation; this is
a backstop against a manual run overlapping a scheduled one.

State root is `TA_STATE` (env) or `<repo>/state`, then `/<agent>` — so agents never share
a watermark file.
