"""Singleton terminal driver, shared by every triggered-agent.

Replaces `orca automations run` in the systemd trigger. One agent = one warm terminal in
its worktree, reused across ticks. On a trigger (after precheck passes, under the run lock):

  * no agent terminal          -> create one running the agent's resolved head profile
  * one idle agent terminal    -> `/clear` it and re-send <skill> (warm reuse, kills nothing)
  * ...unless its head is red  -> stop it, start a fresh one on the resolved fallback instead
  * ...unless agent is ephemeral -> stop + tear down instead, start a fresh one (see below)
  * it's busy and fresh        -> leave it working, dispatch nothing
  * it's busy but stuck        -> watchdog: stop the workspace and start one fresh

Why warm reuse and not stop+create every run: Orca retains a dead pty as a ghost tab in the
workspace session after the process exits, so churning a terminal each tick piles up ghost tabs.
Reuse never kills the process, so no ghost is born — steady state stays at one terminal. The rare
kill paths (watchdog, a red idle head, closing legacy duplicates) do leave ghosts, so every run
first reaps them via `session.tabs.close` (`_reap_ghosts`) — the one lever that reaches the
session store; the `terminal` CLI can't. Together: steady state creates none, and any stray gets
swept next tick.

An agent whose automation.toml sets `ephemeral = true` (curator, triggered-agents-445) opts out
of warm reuse entirely: `_is_ephemeral` gates the idle branch above `_reuse_head_is_red`, so an
idle terminal is always stopped and replaced rather than `/clear`-ed, and a stuck one is already
stopped+replaced by the watchdog branch regardless of this flag. Both kill paths now reap their
own ghost tab immediately (not just at the top of the next run), so a completed/stuck/errored
ephemeral run never leaves its PTY or tab behind for someone else to notice. This matters for
curator specifically: its skill writes to shared memory canon off what it reads from its own
session, so a stale warm session risks carrying forward context (or a half-finished write) from a
prior tick into the next one's judgment.

Every one of those kill paths is still only ever REACHED by a future tick's poll, a dispatch.run()
call noticing after the fact that the terminal has gone idle or stuck. For an ephemeral agent that
isn't good enough on its own: `_create_terminal` appends a `; `-separated launcher trailer to the
head's command. On head exit it starts a detached `finalize()` helper (`dispatch --finalize`) that
survives the PTY it stops, then confirms terminal removal and closes the parent tab without a poll.
`run()`'s cleanup-only/watchdog/stray-sweep paths remain the backstop for a terminal that never
reaches its trailer at all (a hard kill, host reboot, Orca itself restarting).

Why not `orca automations run`: it dispatches trigger=manual and spawns a NEW head every tick
(reuse only kicks in for scheduled runs, which don't tick headless), so heads piled up.

"Busy vs idle" is Orca's tui-idle condition; "stuck" is busy with no output for
WATCHDOG_SECONDS. Orca's agent status is known to wedge on 'working' after a silent exit, so a
bare busy check would freeze the agent forever — the watchdog makes "skip when busy" safe.
Dispatch only sends the skill and returns; the head reaches `advance` (same lock) minutes later,
so there's no deadlock.

Every fresh spawn (create, watchdog-restart) goes through `_ensure_claude_ready` first
(`claude_env.ensure_trust`/`ensure_theme`): a head that lands on the folder-trust dialog or the
onboarding theme picker hangs on stdin nobody sends, and never renames its tab away from the
shell default — invisible to the `Claude`-in-title match above, so it's neither reused nor
reaped and just sits there as a silent orphan (found live in the curator workspace: a terminal
stuck at "choose the text style" that `_agent_terminals` couldn't see).

A live terminal never re-resolves its head profile on its own, so every spawn that resolves one
(create, watchdog-restart, red-fallback) records it via `AgentState.save_head_profile` — the only
place idle-reuse can learn which resource the warm terminal is actually running against, since
that can already be a fallback and differ from the agent's static preferred head
(triggered-agents-275).

More invariants, all from PR #95 review rounds (triggered-agents-445):

  * `run(..., cleanup_only=True)` — `ta-gate.sh`'s call on a precheck skip (no new work). Never
    dispatches a skill; for an ephemeral agent it still runs `_cleanup_only` on a finished/stuck
    terminal, because `dispatch` (and thus every kill path above) is otherwise never invoked at
    all on a skip tick — a finished ephemeral run could sit until the next tick that happens to
    have real work, unbounded if that never comes (round 1 review B1). It bails immediately for a
    non-ephemeral agent (retro/steward) — before even constructing `AgentState` or taking
    `state.lock()`, let alone any Orca/board call: their lifecycle is out of scope, so their
    precheck-skip stays the exact zero-side-effect no-op it always was, and a shared gate calling
    `--cleanup-only` on every skip can never turn their quiet tick into a lock-contention
    `SystemExit` (round 2 review B2, hardened round 5 review B1).
    `triggered_agents/__main__.py`'s `pipeline` special case (a deterministic dispatcher with no
    terminal at all) treats `--cleanup-only` the same way, never calling `dispatcher.tick()`
    (round 2 review B1) — a shared gate script means every agent it dispatches to, including a
    skill-less deterministic one, must understand the flag as "there is nothing to do here".
  * Every "stop, then create" path (watchdog-restart, ephemeral-restart, red-fallback) verifies
    the stop actually worked via `_stop_and_confirm` — re-listing terminals rather than trusting
    `terminal stop`'s exit code — before spawning the replacement, and bails without creating if
    it can't confirm. Otherwise a silently-failed stop plus an unconditional create risks two live
    sessions for one singleton agent (round 1 review B3).
  * The "no terminal" branch checks `AgentState.load_terminal_created_at()` against
    `CREATE_VISIBILITY_GRACE_S` before creating: a terminal this same agent just created may not
    be visible in `terminal list` yet, and a second dispatch landing in that gap must not read
    that as "nothing was ever spawned" and create a duplicate (round 1 review B2).
  * Both the "no terminal" branch and `_cleanup_only`, when `_agent_terminals` recognizes nothing,
    still check `_raw_terminal_count` — Orca's unfiltered terminal list for the workspace — and
    sweep (`_stop_and_confirm_workspace_empty` + `_reap_ghosts`) before creating or declaring the
    workspace clean. `_agent_terminals`'s title/handle filter can miss a genuinely live stray (an
    orphan stuck on the shell's default title), which would otherwise survive every tick forever —
    recognized as "empty" and either left alone (cleanup) or piled on top of with a fresh terminal
    (create). `_stop_and_confirm_workspace_empty` (not the narrower `_stop_and_confirm`) verifies
    via the same unfiltered `_raw_terminal_count`, since the filtered view would "confirm" success
    on a stray it could never recognize either way, stopped or not (round 2 review B3).

    `_create_terminal` appends a `--spawn-finalizer --generation <n>` trailer to the head's launch
    command. That launcher starts this function in a detached process the instant the head exits,
    so `terminal stop` cannot kill cleanup halfway through its confirmation and tab reap.
    `dispatch.run`'s cleanup-only/watchdog/stray-sweep paths remain the backstop for a terminal
    that never reaches its trailer at all (a hard kill, host reboot, Orca restart).

    Takes `state.lock()`, exactly like `run()`, because the teardown stops the whole workspace. On
    contention it no longer abandons cleanup outright (round 4, review B2): a live tick holds the
    lock only for the span of its own Orca calls, so `finalize` retries a bounded number of times
    before deferring. That retry is safe only because the teardown itself is generation-guarded
    (`_finalize_locked`): even if this finalizer wins the lock right after a concurrent tick already
    replaced its terminal, it recognizes the newer generation and reaps instead of stopping, so it
    never kills the fresh replacement. If a tick stays wedged on the lock for the whole window,
    `finalize` logs `self-teardown-deferred` and lets that tick (or the next one) finish the job.

    A no-op for a non-ephemeral agent: `_create_terminal` only ever appends this trailer when
    `_is_ephemeral(agent)`, so retro/steward should never reach here, but staying a no-op keeps it
